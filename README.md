# Chidiebere M. Okere - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, my name is Chidiebere. I am a graduate of Rutgers Business School with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Analytics and Information Technology. Over the years of both in school and personal projects I have developed a strong foundation in the financial service industry with a proficieny in programming languages SQL and Python, visualization tools such as Excel and Tableau, and data integration services, specifically AWS Glue.

In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects to both sharpen my skills and acquire new skills that can aid in furthering my career in data analytics. Currently I'm working on projects that focus on the use of Python and PowerBI.
