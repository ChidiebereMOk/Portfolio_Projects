# Chidiebere M. Okere - Introduction & Analytics Portfolio Overview
## About
Hi, my name is Chidiebere. I am a graduate of Rutgers Business School with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Analytics and Information Technology. Over the years of both in school and personal projects I have developed a strong foundation and proficieny in programming languages SQL and Python, visualization tools such as Excel, Tableau, and PowerBI and data integration services, specifically AWS Glue.

In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects to both sharpen my skills and acquire new skills that can aid in furthering my career in data analytics.

## Portfolio Overview
In this section I will provide an brief breakdown of the projects I have completed and the various tools used to complete each project, including links to their repositories.
## [Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Analysis](https://github.com/ChidiebereMOk/CVD-Analysis)

**Task Overview:**  
Analyze a medical dataset of patient records to explore health risk indicators associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), focusing on lifestyle and biometric factors.

**Actions Taken:**  
- Cleaned and transformed raw data:
  - Converted age to years, height to inches, and weight to pounds
  - Translated encoded values (e.g., gender, cholesterol, glucose levels) into readable categories
- Used SQL to extract insights on:
  - Patient demographics and BMI
  - Cholesterol and glucose correlations with CVD
  - Behavioral risk factors (smoking, alcohol, activity) by CVD status

**Results:**  
  - Patients were evenly split by gender with an average age in the mid-50s
  - Identified the proportion of patients with vs. without cardiovascular disease suggesting a targeted sample of patients
  - Patients with above or well-above normal cholesterol/glucose levels had higher CVD incidence
  - Inactive patients and those who smoke or drink showed higher rates of CVD
  - A notable subset of healthy-behavior individuals still developed CVD, suggesting other contributing factors

## [Seattle Real Estate Sales](https://github.com/ChidiebereMOk/Tableau--SQL-Projects/blob/main/Seattle%20Real%20Estate%20Sales/Seattle%20King%20County%20Real%20Estate%20Sales%20Analysis.sql)

**Task Overview:**  
Analyze house sale trends in King County, WA to identify price drivers and market patterns.

**Actions Taken:**  
- Performed SQL queries to analyze pricing trends, property features, and location effects
- Evaluated construction year trends, grade distributions, and monthly sales volumes
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters, maps, and histograms

**Results:**  
- Identified highest average prices by zip code and property condition
- Observed strong market activity in newer and high-grade homes
- Created an interactive dashboard for temporal and geographic filtering



## [At Home Furniture Sales Analysis](https://github.com/ChidiebereMOk/Tableau--SQL-Projects/blob/main/At%20Home%20Furniture%20Sales/Furniture%20Sales%20Query%20Analysis.sql)

**Task Overview:**  
Evaluatioin of At Home Furniture's 2023 sales data to uncover product, customer, and regional performance trends

**Actions Taken:**  
- Used SQL to extract insights on sales volume, profit, customer behavior, and delivery delays
- Identified top-performing products, regions, and sales months
- Built a Tableau dashboard comparing 2023 vs. 2022 metrics across KPIs

**Results:**  
- Identified the top-selling regions which generated the highest revenue and the average order values of each
- Which products had the most significant contribution to overall revenue

## [Bee Populations in the US](https://github.com/ChidiebereMOk/Declining-Bee-Populations-in-the-US/blob/main/README.md)

**Task Overview:**  
Clean and transform raw bee colony data and perform a comprehensive analysis of trends from 2002 to 2017. This involved identifying which regions experienced the most significant population changes, analyzing statistical patterns, and building a forecast model to project future colony counts.

**Actions:**
- Cleaned and structured multiple raw datasets using SQL, including standardizing data types, parsing geographical codes, handling missing values, and creating a relational schema for bee colonies, populations, and regions.
- Used SQL to join datasets, map codes to readable state and county names, and compute colony totals and changes over time.
- Created data visualizations using matplotlib in Python with bar plots, histograms, and linear regression charts.
- Performed statistical analysis including descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk normality testing, and Pearson correlation by region.
- Built a linear regression model to examine the trend in colony counts over time and used Prophet to forecast colony populations for five additional years.

**Results:**
- Discovered a net national decrease in bee colonies from 2002 to 2017.
- Identified top states and counties that experienced the largest growth in bee populations.
- Found colony distributions were non-normal and skewed, with significant regional variation.
- Correlation analysis revealed strong positive trends in specific states.
- Forecasting models projected an increase in colonies nationwide under current conditions.
